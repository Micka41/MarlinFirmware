Source code is here: [https://github.com/ThomasToka/Marlin/tree/MARLIN-E3S1PROFORK-BYTT]

The official pull request is here: https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/pull/25948

This firmware is for the Creality Ender 3 S1 Pro and Ender 3 S1 Plus.

It has its own screen firmware for DWIN and Dacai displays. This firmware is backward compatible with the stock
screen display firmware. Naturally then only the stock features are available.

Expect updates of other non patched firmwares with this fixes then.. lol

But hej. I will release the fixes. :-)

Please read the installation.txt in the release for full update instructions!

Be carefully with your printer. Mine works fine. But this is a new build. 

So have your fingers near the power button when lowering your z-axis and starting print for the first time.

Please open an issue if there is something wrong.
